- `Problem` - 
The problem we identified here as a team is that in a situation of a medical emergency, many people panic and don't know what to do in the situation. Many times they also don't know the exact location where to call the ambulance.

- `Solution` - 
-- The solution our web app is providing :
1 - It provides the basic first aid in a concise format so that a simple life-saving operation can be done.

2 - It provides you with a YouTube tutorial that would help you to save your cherished ones.

3 - It also takes the user's location and provides them with their current location at a single place.

4 - It would also list down all the nearby hospitals that are in the range of users' locations in a single click.
